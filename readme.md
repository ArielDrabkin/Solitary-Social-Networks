# Social Network Analysis in an Extreme Solitary Reptile Species

This repository contains the code and data for a data science project that explores the existence of a social network in an extreme type of solitary reptile species. The study focuses on the Sinai chameleon (Chamaeleo chamaeleon musae), an annual lizard that inhabits desert shrubs and does not have permanent burrows. The aim of the project is to examine the hypothesis that even in such extreme solitary species, a social network can be identified by analyzing the locations of the individuals.

## Introduction
The social structure of different species has been studied using social networks, which capture encounters or interactions between individuals in a population. However, the social networks of extremely solitary species, like the Sinai chameleon, have not been explored extensively. This project aims to fill this gap by investigating the potential for microorganism transmission in extreme solitary species.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of 851 records of chameleon sleeping locations collected in two field sites near Ashalim. The data was collected monthly from 2009 to 2017, covering a period of six full years (2012-2017). It includes a total of 880 sleeping locations.

## Methods
The analysis was performed using R language and various packages such as geosphere and igraph. The following steps were followed to construct the social network:

1. Calculated the distance between all capture points of individual chameleons using the geosphere package.
2. Identified overlaps and close distances between individuals to determine encounters.
3. Constructed a "Time - Lag" social network based on the number of same sites (i.e., strength of interactions) using the igraph package.

The analysis revealed the presence of a social network in the Sinai chameleon population for each year studied. The social networks varied in complexity and were based on different numbers of encounters between individuals. Notably, 2015 had the most complicated social network with 319 encounters, while 2013 had the fewest (89) encounters and the simplest social network.
## Discussion
The study's findings suggest that the Sinai chameleon, despite being an extreme solitary reptile species without permanent burrows, exhibits a social network. This supports previous observations of social networks in solitary reptiles with permanent burrows. The existence of encounters among individuals in extreme solitary species can lead to microorganism transmission, potentially affecting individual fitness. Further research is required to understand the stability and transmission of microorganisms among reptiles, but the study provides a theoretical foundation and highlights the importance of collecting field data.
